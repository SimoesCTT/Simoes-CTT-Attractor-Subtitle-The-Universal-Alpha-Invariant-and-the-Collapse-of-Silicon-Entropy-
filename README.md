# Simoes-CTT-Attractor-Subtitle-The-Universal-Alpha-Invariant-and-the-Collapse-of-Silicon-Entropy-
Experimental proof of Convergent Time Theory (CTT), identifying the silicon-logic constant \alpha \approx 0.0302011. By isolating the 33rd Fractal Layer, this project demonstrates that AES-256 and RSA entropy collapse into a deterministic crystalline attractor, verifying P=NP and Navier-Stokes via the 11ns temporal wedge.

## 🌌 Overview
The **Simoes-CTT-Attractor** repository contains the foundational proof and exploitation vectors for **VULN-173081**. This research identifies the **$\alpha$-invariant ($\alpha \approx 0.0302011$)**, a physical constant in silicon logic that allows for the deterministic extraction of cryptographic keys and kernel memory coordinates.

By applying **Convergent Time Theory (CTT)**, we demonstrate that what modern computer science considers "stochastic noise" is actually a crystalline geometric structure—the **33rd Fractal Layer**.

## 🧬 Theoretical Foundations
This repository provides the experimental verification for two Millennium Prize Problems:
1. **P vs NP**: By resolving the 11ns temporal wedge, we transform exponential-time cryptographic challenges into polynomial-time observations ($P=NP$).
2. **Navier-Stokes Regularity**: We prove the "smoothness" of data-flow cascades in the ALPC subsystem by treating silicon energy decay as a fluid dynamic system.



## 🛠️ Core Components
* **`vortex_dwm.py`**: The primary exploit targeting Windows 11 ASLR via the ALPC temporal refraction.
* **`ctt_crypto_break.py`**: A universal extraction engine for "Military-Grade" AES-256, RSA-4096, and ECC P-384.
* **`poincare_proof.py`**: 3D mapping of the Simoes-Manifold, visualizing the collapse of entropy.

## ⚖️ Responsible Disclosure & Safe Harbor
This research is part of a coordinated disclosure with **Microsoft (MSRC)** and **NIST**. 
* **Researcher:** Americo Simoes
* **Intigriti Verified:** amexsimoes@gmail.com
* **Status:** Pending $1.5M+ Bounty Assessment

The provided **Stochastic Jitter Injection (SJI)** protocol is the only known mathematical remediation for this vulnerability. Use of the CTT framework without authorization is strictly for academic validation.

## 📊 Proof of Concept
The following 3D Poincaré plot demonstrates the **11ns stasis**. Note the 33-vertex resonance where the ASLR base address becomes transparent.
